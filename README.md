✧ :: Artist + Animator + eventual(?) game dev

✧ :: If I have you blocked on GitHub, it's likely because I got uncomfortable around you. though I do get uncomfortable around people easily so don't take this too personally

✧ :: I have a habit of "trash-talking" things I don't like (I.E, ships, characters, people, etc).

♢ :: if you want to talk to me, you can do it via my [neospring](https://neospring.org/@anova/)
