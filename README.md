✧ :: Artist + Animator + eventual(?) game dev

✧ :: If I have you blocked on GitHub, it's likely because I got uncomfortable around you. though I do get uncomfortable around people easily so don't take this too personally

✧ :: I have a habit of "trash-talking" things I don't like (I.E, ships, characters, people, etc).

:: as stated on my profile, I do get uncomfortable other people very easily, and what usually comes after is a unfriend/unfollow. I do understand that my lack of talking to other people beforehand can cause confusion or even anger- and I'm sorry. just.. try not to take it too personally. if you want to talk about it to me for more detail,  I'd prefer it if you did so via my [neospring](https://neospring.org/@anova/)
